# 📚 Library Manager

A simple console-based library checkout system built in Java using Object-Oriented Programming principles.

## 🧠 What It Does
- View available library books
- Check out books to a user
- Return books back to the library
- Validates user actions (can’t check out unavailable books, can’t return books you don’t have)

## 🚀 Features
- User class stores each user’s personal checked-out books
- Library class manages available books using an ArrayList<String>
- Clean menu-driven interaction using Scanner
- Simple, readable OOP design with clear class responsibilities

## 📦 Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 17+ recommended)
- Standard Java libraries (ArrayList, Scanner)

## 🧪 How to Run
- Copy all files into an IDE like IntelliJ or VS Code
- Run Main.java
- Use options 1–2 to manage book returns and checkouts
- Type q to quit the program

## 📚 What I Learned
- Structuring Java programs across multiple classes
- Managing dynamic lists using ArrayList
- Creating simple user/account systems
- Handling invalid input and preventing bad operations
- Keeping logic separate between entities (User) and system manager (Library)

## 📅 Completed as part of my Level 2 Java OOP project ladder
